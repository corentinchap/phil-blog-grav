<p>The Mediator theme for Grav is a direct port of the <a href="https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator">Mediator Theme for Jekyll</a> designed by <a href="http://blog.base68.com/about/">Dirk Fabisch</a> which in turn was inspired by the <a href="http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/">Readium 2.0 Theme for Ghost</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of minor tweaks and adjustments have been made to better take advantage of Grav features and functionality.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fully Responsive layout</li>
<li>Use header images in articles, if you want to (add tag "image" and url to the image in the front matter section of a post)</li>
<li>Minimal design</li>
<li>Featured article support</li>
<li>FontAwesome implemented for easy use of icons fonts</li>
<li>Free &amp; Open Source Font usage</li>
</ul>
